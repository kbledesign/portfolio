# Front End Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is my public space where I showcase my front-end development work. Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and I will be continuously updating it with new projects and improvements.

## About Me

I am a NYC based front-end developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. I have gained valuable experience during my time at Shiseido, where I had the opportunity to work on various front-end projects. In addition to my professional work, I have also included a React project in this portfolio.
